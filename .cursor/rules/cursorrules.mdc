## 🔹 UI / UX Guidelines
- Layout must match **Figma mockup**:
  - **Left column (fixed width ~280px):**
    - Title → Calendar → Daily entry card → Record button → Upload button.  
    - All visible at once without scrolling.  
  - **Right column (flexible):**
    - Title “Watch Movie”
    - 2x2 video grid  
    - “Random moment” button at bottom right.
- **Minimal** styling (color/styling will be added later).
- **Inter font** only.
- Everything must **fit in 100% viewport height**.
- Left panel stays fixed, right panel scrolls if needed.

## 🔹 Tech Guidelines
- Use **React + Tailwind** (keep code simple and readable).
- Calendar should be **compact** (only ~220px height).
- Videos should be **saved in local storage** (for MVP).
- Must be **responsive** for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Keep “Make Movie” popup simple but extensible (modular).
- Code should be clean, reusable components.
